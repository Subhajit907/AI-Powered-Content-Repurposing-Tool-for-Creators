1. Generate 3 viral short-form video scripts (60 seconds max) from this content:
   - Platform 1: TikTok
   - Platform 2: YouTube Shorts
   - Platform 3: Instagram Reels
   - Each script should include:
     - A strong hook (first 5 seconds)
     - A brief value-packed body (educational or motivational)
     - A CTA (subscribe, follow, comment, or visit link)
     - Style should be conversational, friendly, and energetic like Holly's tone

2. Automatically generate **subtitles (captions)** for each short video based on the script.

3. Suggest a **viral title** for each platform based on its style:
   - TikTok: Trendy, attention-grabbing, uses Gen Z lingo if appropriate
   - YouTube Shorts: SEO-optimized, clear benefit-driven
   - Instagram Reels: Bold, emotional trigger, uses emojis if it helps

4. Ensure the tone and voice are aligned with this creator, who is strategic, practical, and inspirational. Keep the brand voice consistent.
